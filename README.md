# apache-ignite-masterclass

Setup can be tested by starting ServerStartup class. This will bring up single node cluster

**Please start App1 App2 and App3 to show data distribution and collocation**

We will use Department and students studying in that department as examples in our demos

Demos include 3 main sections
1. 3 node cluster
2. Scan Queries
3. Sql queries
4. Data distribution and collocation using affinity
5. Compute Tasks to list data stored on each node as an example
6. Continuous query to capture cache entry updates
7. Integrating external storage using cache store adapters
8. And finally using ignite as pure in-memory database
